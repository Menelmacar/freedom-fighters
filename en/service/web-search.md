## Concept

You may be tempted to proxy your queries towards a monopolist through a metasearch engine.
Here are some reasons why this is not desirable:

* Profile through correlation via timing, typos, some other property of successive queries or the phrase itself
* You may accidentally copy & paste personal data
* Every search you execute may finance the upstream search provider directly by way of commission
* You help improve the upstream search provider by providing input to popularity, phrases, parsing, query refinement and result ranking
* You are not helping improve the competitors by withholding these crowdsourced inputs
