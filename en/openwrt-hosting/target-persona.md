# Target persona

We must initially target those who already have an inclination towards using such a system with all its [drawbacks](drawbacks.md).

## Phase 1

* OpenWrt developers who would enjoy seeing new innovative use cases and implementation and the QA testing coverage improvement it could bring
* Developers who enjoy cross-compilation and improving the cross-platform compatibility of code
* Developers who are fed up with everyday bloat and want to see how lean we could get

## Phase 2

* An expert who already has a few additional OpenWrt packages installed for hosting simple networking services. Allows them to widen their portfolio as a form of experimentation or "for the show".
* An expert who already self-hosts at home on a more capable platform but would like to save money by reducing their power consumption (-> energy crisis) and/or even sell the previous expensive hardware (a PC or Raspberry Pi 4) to replace it with a much less expensive one and/or has fans and would prefer to ditch all moving parts cheaply.
* Environmental protection advocates who would love to see a reduction in electronic waste by giving old computing hardware a second life

## Phase 3

* An expert who already self-hosts in a cloud VPS but who would like to try different privacy trade offs by having their data within arm's reach
* An expert who would prefer off-site backup or archiving could deploy such redundant node(s) at friends and family without breaking the bank. Those living at the sites of deployment might grow a liking of the idea, especially if reminding them regularly via image sharing hosted over them and such. They could then be given accounts on them.

## Phase 4

* A curious one who has an expert friend who self-hosts (either at home or in the cloud), but would not like to spend so much on it (either monthly or as an upfront investment). Hosting a minimal-version of "the real thing" often brings almost as much entertainment.
* A student on the budget who would like to learn about servers and/or who is privacy-savvy, but can't afford to shell out the price tag of better solutions
* A possible selling point to a novice who wants to purchase a router - giving a reason why it should be compatible with OpenWrt (voting with their money) or installing it on an existing router (QA and education). They will always ask this and after seeing the type of services available, will always ask for more. Even if they don't install the given packages in the end, OpenWrt and FOSS will benefit either way.

## Phase 5

* A migration path for existing users of various heavier FOSS federated services considered non-mainstream who would be capable of hosting a service but could not be bothered up until now due to the costs or complexity involved, see matrix.org fediverse.party NextCloud.com

## Phase 6

* A migration path for existing users of non-FOSS, potentially centralized services, but which are still considered non-mainstream. They have made the conscious decision of avoiding the mainstream for a reason and may just need a bit nudging along with heavy support from UX, documentation, instructional multimedia and tech support.

## Phase 7

* General population - would probably require creative financial backing
