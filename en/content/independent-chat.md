# Independent chat platforms with English speaking content

## Foreword

The main difference between forums and chat is that content on forums is usually readable publicly without registration and readily indexed by web search engines. See also:

### DeltaLab

### ArcaneChat

A fork of Delta.Chat with advanced features you can install for Android from the following link. It was formerly called "DeltaLab".

* https://github.com/ArcaneChat/android#arcanechat-android-client
* https://github.com/deltalab-org/deltalab-android#deltalab-android-client

You can then join so called anonymous "communities" built on shared mailboxes that opens up the possibility to collaborate in separate topics. Get in contact with the following to join the community named "DeltaFans":
